bugfixes:
  - cisco.nxos.nxos_facts - Fix ``AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'get'`` when gathering interface facts on devices where an interface has multiple IPv6 addresses. NXOS returns ``TABLE_addr.ROW_addr`` as a list of dicts in that case; the parser now handles both single-dict and list-of-dicts shapes.
