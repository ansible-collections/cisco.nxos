major_changes:
  - "nxos_file_copy has been rewritten as a module. This change also removes the dependency on pexpect for file_pull operation.
    Since this now uses AnsibleModule class for argspec validation, the validation messages will be slighlty different. Expect changes
    in the return payload in some cases. All functionality remains unchanged."
