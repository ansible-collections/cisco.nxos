module: nxos_vrf_interfaces
short_description: Resource module to configure VRF interfaces.
description: This module configures and manages the VRF configuration in interface on NX-OS platforms.
version_added: 9.2.1
author: Ruchi Pakhle (@Ruchip16)
notes:
  - Tested against Cisco NX-OS.
  - This module works with connection C(network_cli).
options:
  config:
    description: A list of VRF interfaces options.
    type: list
    elements: dict
    suboptions:
      name:
        description:
          - Full name of the interface excluding any logical unit number,
            i.e. Ethernet1/1.
        type: str
        required: true
      vrf_name:
        description:
          - Vrf that is to be added to the interface.
        type: str
        required: true
  running_config:
    description:
      - This option is used only with state I(parsed).
      - The value of this option should be the output received from the NX-OS
        device by executing the command B(sh running-config interface).
      - The state I(parsed) reads the configuration from C(running_config)
        option and transforms it into Ansible structured data as per the
        resource module's argspec and the value is then returned in the
        I(parsed) key within the result.
    type: str
  state:
    description:
      - The state the configuration should be left in
      - The states I(rendered), I(gathered) and I(parsed) does not perform any
        change on the device.
      - The state I(rendered) will transform the configuration in C(config)
        option to platform specific CLI commands which will be returned in the
        I(rendered) key within the result. For state I(rendered) active
        connection to remote host is not required.
      - The state I(gathered) will fetch the running configuration from device
        and transform it into structured data in the format as per the resource
        module argspec and the value is returned in the I(gathered) key within
        the result.
      - The state I(parsed) reads the configuration from C(running_config)
        option and transforms it into JSON format as per the resource module
        parameters and the value is returned in the I(parsed) key within the
        result. The value of C(running_config) option should be the same format
        as the output of command I(show running-config | include ip route|ipv6
        route) executed on device. For state I(parsed) active connection to
        remote host is not required.

      - merged
      - replaced
      - overridden
      - deleted
      - gathered
