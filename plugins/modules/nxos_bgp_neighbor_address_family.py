module: nxos_bgp_neighbor_address_family
short_description: BGP Neighbor Address Family resource module.
description:
- This module manages BGP Neighbor Address Family configuration on devices running Cisco NX-OS.
version_added: 2.0.0
notes:
- Tested against NX-OS 9.3.6.
- Unsupported for Cisco MDS
- For managing BGP address family configurations please use
  the M(cisco.nxos.nxos_bgp_address_family) module.
- This module works with connection C(network_cli) and C(httpapi).
author: Nilashish Chakraborty (@NilashishC)
options:
  running_config:
    description:
    - This option is used only with state I(parsed).
    - The value of this option should be the output received from the NX-OS device
      by executing the command B(show running-config | section '^router bgp').
    - The state I(parsed) reads the configuration from C(running_config) option and
      transforms it into Ansible structured data as per the resource module's argspec
      and the value is then returned in the I(parsed) key within the result.
